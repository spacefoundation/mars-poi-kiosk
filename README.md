"A Touch of Mars" Points of Interest Touchscreen Kiosk
==============

Powered by Away3D (http://away3d.com), this full-screen points of interest (POI) kiosk invites visitors to explore Mars at a glance. It features a rotating globe with the most notable interest points and landing spots. 

The kiosk is designed for high resolution (1920x1080) single-touch touchscreens optimally powered by a high-performance PC, Mac or Linux computer.

Created using Flash CS6 Professional, Adobe AIR 3.4 (for Desktop)

IMPORTANT: This project is at an very early stage. Don't expect much at this point. :D
